## 💡 PRO TIPS

### **For Maximum Impact:**

1. **Show Real Data:** Use actual ID cards (with personal info blurred) rather than synthetic ones
2. **Highlight Failures Too:** Showing where the system struggles adds credibility
3. **Comparison is Key:** Before/after, yours vs. competitors, with vs. without features
4. **Annotate Everything:** Don't assume reviewers will understand unlabeled images
5. **Consistency Matters:** Use same font, color scheme, and style across all figures
6. **Quality Over Quantity:** 5 excellent figures > 10 mediocre ones

### **Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
- ❌ Low-resolution, blurry images
- ❌ Too much information in one figure
- ❌ Inconsistent styling between figures
- ❌ Missing or vague captions
- ❌ Using copyrighted images without permission
- ❌ Forgetting to anonymize personal data

### **Novelty Highlights Through Images:**
- ✨ Template-based ROI approach (Figure 4)
- ✨ Real-time processing on standard hardware (Figure 7b)
- ✨ Multi-format support without retraining (Figure 8)
- ✨ Integrated anti-spoofing (Figure 9)
- ✨ Proven real-world deployment (Figure 10)
